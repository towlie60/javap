   Homework

// if the vendor brings a product
and it's green products then set the expiration date for 7 days for all green

except

1.if it's cilantro set the expiration date for 10 days.
2.for dill please make expiration date for 4 days
   //Grocery Store
   // Greens


   //Fruits --> fruits should be expired in 30 days by default

   except:
   //raspberries should be expired in 30 days by default
   // bananas should be expired in 15 days by default
   //


   //Vegatables

   all veggies should expire in 90 days

   except:
   Tomatoes in 20 days
   Pumpkin in 60 days

   String productType = "";

outter if statement --> is an if statement that has a another if statement in its body.

inner if statement --> is an if statement that doesn't have any if statement.



multi level nested ifs.

if the productType is Fruit
and the productName is Banana
then ask the user to input where is the banana imported from?
get the input from user.

String import;

if banana is imported from "Peru" set daysToExpire = 11;
if banana is imported from "Brazil" set daysToExpire = 14;

   //  else if()
 //  } //outer close 153

//System.out.println(daysToExpire);
