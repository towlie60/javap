//            1. java unit testing —> Junit is an open source java library that helps excuting unit tests in automated way
//
//    open source —> means free to use
//
//    java library- means some java program (classes) that we can use to achieve some tasks. so some company (guys) developed a program that solves a problem so we just reuse their solutions.
//
//    right now all we have to do is to learn how to use programs that someone has created
//
//    ex of libraries:
//
//    jdk libraries → scanner, system, random, math, string.
//
//    external libraries —> junit, TestNG, Cucumber, Selenium, JDBC, RestAssured, Jackson, Hamcrest.
//
//    external libraries are not included into our problem, so we have to dowload .jar(java architype) file and import it to our java project
//
//    some .jar file(libraries) will have a dependency on other .jar files(libraries)
//
//    java is super cool in that it you can create programs for user to use or you create programs for other developers to use.
//
//            .jar → is the final artifact of a java program.
//
//            dependency —> dependent on, can not work without some other jar file.
//
//    what is a method?
//
//            -is a block of code which runs only when we call it?
//
//            -we use methods in order to avoid repetition of the same logic in the code. you can use the logic everywhere you need it. if there is a change in the logic then you only need to change it in one place. that gives you great code maintainability.
//
//    unit test —> is a test of a java method. this is done developer of an application
//
//    unit test is the first test in the whole hierachy of tests.
//
//    unit test if a first level of test automation
//
//    junit helps getting result of method, and creating report. it helps executing multiple(1000 tests) at once.
